Forest Hills Sound Map is a sound map consisting of field recordings made in 2005 in my former neighborhood, Forest Hills, Queens. I made binaural field recordings in various locations and connected them to their corresponding spot on a map. As you mouse around on the map, the cursor reveals a sonic representation of that location as well as a color satellite map.The recordings were made with binaural microphones, so listen with headphones for full effect.There are sixteen sonic points. See if you can find them all.​
