Forest Hills Sound Map is a sound map consisting of field recordings made in 2005 in my former neighborhood, Forest Hills, Queens.  I made binaural field recordings in various locations and connected them to their corresponding spot on a map. <br /><img src='/images/portfolio/forest_hills_soundmap.png'>
