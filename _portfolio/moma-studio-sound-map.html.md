Built a sound map for exploring field recordings made around the world as part of a multisensory environment called Common Senses in conjunction with the exhibition Century of the Child.
Visitors are invited to make field recordings and submit them to MoMA's Soundcloud DropBox along with the recording location.  Visitors can hear sounds by exploring an kiosk map in the museum, or by visiting the online sound map.   Clicking the markers triggers the sound recorded at the marker.
