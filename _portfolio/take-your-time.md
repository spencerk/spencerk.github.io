Visitors to Olafur Eliasson's Take Your Time exhibition at MoMA and PS1 wear cell phone necklaces that record their experience.  An app developed for the Nokia N85 in Python takes photos at a short interval and uploads them to flickr.  Selected images are displayed as background on MoMA's Take Your Time exhibition subsite.​
