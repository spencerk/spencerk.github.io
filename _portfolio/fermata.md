Auditory calendar software for the visually impaired. Goal was to provide quick access to calendar data using sound, and can therefore be useful for sighted users with the trend of ever-decreasing mobile phone screen sizes. Fermata was presented at the Microsoft Design Expo competition in July 2005, where it won the award for Best Concept, and at the 2006 O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.
