Sonic Body Pong is based on Atari's classic video game Pong, and takes place in real space, with the players using their bodies as paddles. The ball is experienced by the players purely through spatialized sound piped to the players via headphones. Featured at the 2006 Come Out and Play Festival and presented at the 2007 O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference.
