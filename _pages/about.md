Hello there! I’m a technologist with experience working at museums and cultural institutions. I’m currently the Senior Manager of Application Development at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where I lead a team of developers who build and support the museum’s digital products, like [metmuseum.org](https://www.metmuseum.org), [The Timeline of Art History](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah), and the APIs for the collection and [Open Access](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access).

Before the Met, I was a developer at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). There, I worked in Digital on the team that built the native MoMA Audio+ apps, [moma.org](https://www.moma.org), and various interventions in the galleries.

My background is in field recording and sound design, and I attended the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, where I combined my background in audio and web development to build projects that focus on the use of sound and space.
