By focusing on the soundscape in which we are immersed, we can find new appreciation of our surroundings, as well as discover a pallette of material from which to create art. The soundwalk is an excellent method for exploring a space and collecting material for sound-based works. Students will learn audio fundamentals and recording and editing techniques, and will participate in listening and field recording exercises. We will also create a digital sound map using the recordings from our field trips.
