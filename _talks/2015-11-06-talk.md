Way-finding is a common challenge for museums, often thought to require significant time and resources to solve. The Met's complex floor plan made developing a useful mobile map for the Met App particularly challenging, especially given our small team and tight timeline. Rather than building an elaborate solution based on assumptions, we quickly developed an MVP that worked on both native platforms. Using a build-measure-learn feedback loop, we iteratively improved the Map based on visitor feedback, enhancing the overall visitor experience.
