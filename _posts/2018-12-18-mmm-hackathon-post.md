The Met, Microsoft, and MIT collaborated on a hackathon to showcase the potential of AI to help democratize and scale the impact of The Met’s collection around the globe. The hack marks the second anniversary of The Met’s Open Access Program, which seeks to make the museum’s collection one of the world’s most accessible, discoverable, and useful. The rich Open Access data set – which now includes new “subject keywords” – provided the foundation for teams of participants across The Met, Microsoft, and MIT to leverage the power of Microsoft AI to uncover new ways for global audiences to connect with over 5,000 years of human history in The Met collection.
